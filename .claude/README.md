# `.claude/` -- Claude Code working layout for BRF

This directory holds the Claude-side scaffolding that makes sessions in
this BRF (BPF Runtime Fuzzer) checkout productive without re-explaining
context every time. It is meant to work alongside a repo-root `CLAUDE.md`
(the always-loaded entry point). At time of writing, only this README and
`SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md` exist -- the rest of the layout (principles,
tasks, archive, settings.local.json) is created on demand as work
crystallizes.

The pattern itself is canonical -- developed in another working tree
and reused unchanged here. See
`SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md` for the full methodology and the rationale
for each piece. This README only documents how it currently lives in
BRF; the *why* lives there.

## What BRF is (so the layout makes sense)

BRF is a Syzkaller-derived, coverage-guided fuzzer that targets the
runtime side of the eBPF subsystem (verifier-passed programs running
under JIT, plus the helpers/maps/attach paths around them). The
codebase is Go (Syzkaller's prog/sys descriptors + a BRF overlay) plus
the C executor and the syscall description files under `sys/linux/`.

The repo's mainline is `dev`; current working branch is
`bootstrap_experimental_v0_01`. `origin` points at the personal fork
`git@github.com:shardulsb08/brf.git`, so this is a working clone, not
a public mirror.

This shape -- a long-running fork with several in-flight changes (new
prog types, new map types, fuzzer tuning, deadlock/repro analysis,
kernel-side patches) -- is exactly the kind of repo
`SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md` was designed for. See the "When to apply
this pattern" section there.

## Intended layout (full form)

```
.claude/
  README.md                       this file
  SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md        canonical methodology (copy of microkernel's)
  settings.local.json             Claude Code local settings (gitignored)
  principles/                     short design-principle files (read on trigger)
    <aspect>.md                   e.g., fuzzer_grammar_discipline.md,
                                  syzkaller_descriptor_conventions.md,
                                  kernel_patch_authoring.md
  tasks/                          per-task working dirs (gitignored)
    index.md                      registry: name, status, keywords, brief path
    <task_slug>/
      CLAUDE.md                   task brief: scope, memory load list, principles
      [optional] commits.md, patch_plan.md, repro_notes.md, ...
  archive/                        retired memories with index
    README.md                     index: what was moved and why
```

Only the README + SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN files exist today. Everything
else is added when the corresponding work appears -- creating empty
scaffolding up front violates the "density wins over completeness"
guidance the pattern itself argues for.

## How a session is meant to start (the contract, once the scaffold is filled in)

1. Repo-root `CLAUDE.md` auto-loads. It tells Claude to read
   `.claude/tasks/index.md` and lists the auto-load reference triggers.
2. Claude reads `tasks/index.md` -- a small file -- to learn active
   tasks and their keyword map.
3. When the user's request matches a task's keywords, Claude **asks
   before loading** the task brief.
4. After loading the brief, Claude follows the brief's memory load
   list and the CLAUDE.md trigger table to read principle files
   automatically, announcing each load so the user can redirect.

Task briefs are gated by user confirmation. Principle files load
automatically when work matches a row in the CLAUDE.md trigger table.
This asymmetry is deliberate -- see `SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md`.

Until a repo-root `CLAUDE.md` is added here, Claude will not
auto-discover this layout. Bootstrapping that file is step 1 of the
"Bootstrapping the pattern in a new repo" section of
`SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md`.

## What's tracked in git vs not (recommended for BRF)

BRF's `origin` is a personal fork, so tracking some of this scaffold
is reasonable. The recommended split mirrors microkernel:

| Path                              | Tracked? | Why                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `.claude/README.md`               | Yes      | Explains the convention                                  |
| `.claude/SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md`| Yes      | Methodology pointer (canonical source lives in microkernel)|
| `.claude/principles/*.md`         | Yes      | Project-wide design philosophy                           |
| `.claude/tasks/`                  | No       | Per-developer working memory                             |
| `.claude/settings.local.json`     | No       | Per-machine Claude Code settings                         |
| `CLAUDE.md` (repo root)           | Yes      | Repo entry point for Claude                              |

The existing `.gitignore` does not yet exclude `.claude/tasks/` or
`.claude/settings.local.json`. When `tasks/` is created, append those
two patterns to `.gitignore` -- otherwise `git status` will start
listing every per-task working note as untracked. (Don't do this
preemptively; do it the first time `tasks/` shows up.)

## BRF-specific candidates for `principles/` (when they earn their slot)

Don't write these speculatively -- write each one only when an actual
session showed Claude needed it. Likely candidates given the work
visible in `git log` and the current diff:

- **Syzkaller descriptor discipline.** How `sys/linux/bpf.txt` and
  `bpf.txt.const` interact, how syz-sysgen consumes them, where the
  ABI lives, why every flag added to a `flags[...]` group must also
  appear in `.const`. (Justified by the arena-map work in the current
  diff.)
- **Fuzzer grammar vs runtime separation.** What's in `prog/` (Go-side
  generation/mutation) vs `executor/` (C-side runtime) vs `sys/linux/`
  (descriptors). Where a given bug class is best fixed.
- **Focused vs broad fuzzing.** When narrowing program-type selection
  is the right move (e.g. the `brf_legacy.go` change restricting to
  LSM/SYSCALL/NETFILTER) and how to revert it cleanly when broad mode
  resumes.
- **Kernel-patch authoring on this fork.** Email, sign-off, AI-tag
  policy for any commit that targets the kernel or bpf-next (distinct
  from BRF-side commits). Relates to global
  `feedback_no_coauthor.md` and `feedback_format_patch_below_cut.md`.

## Adding a new task (when the time comes)

1. Create `.claude/tasks/<task_slug>/CLAUDE.md` -- the brief.
   Sections: goal, scope/anti-scope, memory load list (split:
   critical / helpful / skip), key files in repo, working principles,
   open questions. Use any existing brief from microkernel or the
   Linux clone as a template.
2. Add an entry to `.claude/tasks/index.md` with status, keywords,
   brief path, branch, last touched, one-line goal. Mark
   `status: active` if it's the current focus.
3. Optionally add skeleton sibling files (e.g. `commits.md`,
   `patch_plan.md`, `repro_notes.md`) for working notes.
4. When done: set `status: done` and consider moving the brief
   contents into `.claude/archive/` if there is a write-up worth
   preserving.

## Adding a new design principle

1. Create `.claude/principles/<aspect>.md`. Top of file: a "Read this
   when:" line so Claude knows the trigger condition. Keep it focused
   and short -- principles are read into context, not auto-loaded, so
   density wins over completeness.
2. Add a row to the "Auto-loaded references" table in the repo-root
   `CLAUDE.md` mapping work conditions to the new file.
3. Cross-link from related memory files in the project memory
   directory at
   `~/.claude/projects/-mnt-work-4gb-Tools-003-kernel-testing-prana-kernel-testing-host-drive-tests-bpf-runtime-fuzzer-git-repo-brf/memory/`.

## Why this layout

- **Reduces repeated explanation.** Task scope, principles, and
  memory load lists are encoded once and recalled automatically.
- **Keeps auto-loaded context small.** Only `CLAUDE.md` and
  `MEMORY.md` always load. Briefs and principles are read on-trigger.
- **Separates stable (principles) from volatile (tasks).** Principles
  travel via git; tasks stay local.
- **Asymmetric loading rules**: ask before loading task briefs (large,
  context-heavy); auto-load principle files (small, judgment-shaping).

## Canonical methodology

The pattern here is a per-repo application of a methodology developed
in another working tree.  The full write-up lives next to this README
as `.claude/SESSION_SETUP_PATTERN.md`, which is self-contained for
contributors who don't have the original source tree.
