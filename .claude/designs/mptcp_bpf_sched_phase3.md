# Phase 3 — fuzzing the MPTCP BPF struct_ops scheduler

Design doc for **Phase 3** of the MPTCP harness coverage-gap
backlog (audit gap 1).  Stage A (scoping) is complete and captured
here; Stages B/C/D are the implementation plan.

Auto-loads (per repo `CLAUDE.md`) when work touches the BRF program
generator (`prog/brf*.go`) for the BPF struct_ops scheduler.

## Provenance and scope note

Phase 3 = **gap 1** of `mptcp_coverage_audit_2026-05-21.md` — "the
BPF flagship."  The audit ranked it #1: BRF's own eBPF-generation
strength pointed at a transport-state *write* primitive
(`bpf_mptcp_sched_btf_struct_access`, `net/mptcp/bpf.c:44`) plus 9
MPTCP kfuncs — a surface completely unhit by the rest of the
harness.  The other nine gaps (Phases 1/2/4 — gaps 2-10) are DONE
and committed; Phase 3 is the last item and the the talk's
defensible flagship.

**Scope note:** Phase 3 modifies BRF's *program generator*
(`prog/brf*.go`) — Hung + Sani's core artifact.  The task brief's
original scope said BRF-core changes are "Hung's call."  Pursuing
Phase 3 is a deliberate scope expansion (Shardul's decision,
2026-05-22) and a strong reason to send the drafted Hung+Sani
outreach email.  It remains an *extension* of BRF, not a fork
rename — citation discipline applies.

## Status (2026-05-22)

- **Stage 0** — kernel prerequisites — **DONE**.
- **Stage A** — generator scoping + design — **DONE** (this doc).
- **Stage B** — fixed-scheduler floor — **DONE** (2026-05-22; the
  smoke test passes — see `executor/bpf_progs/README.md`).
- **Stage C-minimal** — generator core — **IMPLEMENTED** (2026-05-22;
  see "Stage C-minimal — implemented" below).  BRF's program
  generator now generates and renders a fuzzed `mptcp_sched_ops`
  struct_ops scheduler.  VM/verifier verification is the follow-up.
- **Stage C-full / D** — pending.

### Stage C-minimal — implemented (2026-05-22)

Implemented in five pieces, all in `prog/`:

1. **struct_ops prog-type + ctxAccess plumbing.** The commented-out
   `BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS` stub in `ProgTypeMap`
   (`brf_types.go`) is replaced with a real entry targeted at
   `mptcp_sched_ops` (`User`/`Kern`: `struct mptcp_sock`,
   `SecDefs`: `{"struct_ops", nil, false}`, empty `FuncProtos` —
   struct_ops uses kfuncs, not numbered helpers).  A
   `CtxAccessMap[BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS]` entry documents the
   read/write surface: broad BTF-typed reads, writes only to
   `snd_burst` / `avg_pacing_rate`.  `mptcp_sock` is deliberately
   *not* added to `ctxStructsMap`, so `InitFromSrc`'s field-access
   loop is skipped (no nil-panic; the struct_ops renderer does not
   use that machinery).
2. **kfunc modelling.** `prog/brf_structops.go` adds `BpfKfunc`
   (a kfunc's `extern … __ksym;` decl) and `mptcpSchedKfuncs` — the
   two kfuncs the fixed `get_send` skeleton needs
   (`bpf_mptcp_subflow_ctx`, `mptcp_subflow_set_scheduled`).
   Arbitrary kfunc-call generation is Stage C-full, out of scope.
3. **`genStructOpsSource()`** — new renderer in
   `prog/brf_structops.go`.  Emits `vmlinux.h` +
   `bpf_helpers.h`/`bpf_tracing.h` includes, the kfunc externs, the
   three `SEC("struct_ops")` `BPF_PROG` callbacks
   (`init`/`release`/`get_send`), and the `SEC(".struct_ops.link")
   struct mptcp_sched_ops` instance.  `get_send` = fixed kfunc
   prologue + generated body + fixed kfunc epilogue.
4. **context-write generation.** `genStructOpsBody` generates a
   short randomised sequence of ctx reads, **ctx writes**
   (`msk->snd_burst = <val>;` / `subflow->avg_pacing_rate = <val>;`
   — the headline write primitive, confined to exactly the two
   `bpf_mptcp_sched_btf_struct_access`-writable fields), and
   arithmetic over the read locals; at least one write per body.
5. **wiring.** `writeCSource` (`brf_prog.go`) routes a struct_ops
   `BpfProg` to `genStructOpsSource`.  `GenBpfProg`
   (`brf_legacy.go`) adds `STRUCT_OPS` as a fourth rotation choice
   and dispatches to `genStructOpsBpfProg`, a separate path that
   leaves the `{LSM,SYSCALL,NETFILTER}` helper-call generator
   untouched.  `BpfProg` gains a `StructOps *StructOpsProg` field
   (gob-serialisable); `isStructOps()` is the discriminator.
   `MutBpfProg` re-rolls a struct_ops body rather than spinning on
   the empty `Calls` list.

Verification status: **host-verified 2026-05-22** (commits
`e894ba00d` + `d2f5aa96b`).  `go build ./prog/...` and `go vet
./prog/` are clean; `go test ./prog/ -run StructOps` passes (64
rendered schedulers; structural, write-target and gob-roundtrip
checks); the rendered sample
`executor/bpf_progs/generated_mptcp_sched_sample.bpf.c`
clang-compiles to a valid struct_ops `.o` (struct_ops +
.struct_ops.link + .BTF).  Remaining: generated schedulers
passing the kernel BPF verifier and registering on a live kernel
-- the VM follow-up, cleanest once Stage D wires executor-side
loading.

## What it is

MPTCP has a pluggable packet scheduler — `struct mptcp_sched_ops`
(`include/net/mptcp.h:104`): `get_send` / `get_retrans` (pick a
subflow) + `init` / `release`.  The kernel lets that scheduler be
supplied as an eBPF **struct_ops** program; `net/mptcp/bpf.c`
registers `mptcp_sched_ops` as a BPF struct_ops and exposes 9
MPTCP kfuncs callable only from such a program.  Phase 3 makes BRF
**generate, load, and fuzz** such a scheduler.

## Stage 0 — kernel prerequisites (DONE)

- **patch 0006** (`faedd54304af9`, kernel patch `0006-*`) — kcov
  scratch-area UAF fix.  Not Phase-3-specific but required for a
  stable BPF-enabled kernel.
- **BPF kernel config** — `tools/configs/samples/brf_mptcp_harness.config`
  now sets `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL` / `BPF_JIT` / `DEBUG_INFO_BTF` plus
  the BRF eBPF config set.  `DEBUG_INFO_BTF` needs `pahole` (host
  has v1.30).  `net/mptcp/bpf.c` builds with `BPF_SYSCALL` + `MPTCP`.
- **clang path** — `prog/brf.go` now resolves `clang-21` via PATH
  (commit `50577fe00`); the host has clang-21 v21.1.0.  No custom
  LLVM build is needed — BRF only ever wanted a *recent* stock
  clang (confirmed from the fork README / `setup_brf.sh`).
  **Needs a BRF rebuild to take effect.**
- **vmlinux.h** — must be regenerated from the now-BTF-enabled
  kernel into `/mnt/brf_work_dir` (a Stage B step — see below).

## How BRF's program generator works (Stage A finding)

Pipeline: `newBpfProg` → `NewBpfProg(progType,…)` builds a `BpfProg`
model (helper/kfunc `Calls`, `Maps`, `Structs`, context vars, a
return value) → `genCSource()` renders it to `.c` → `compileBpfProg`
runs `clang-21` → `.o` (+ a `.gob` of the Go model), all under
`/mnt/brf_work_dir`.

Every generatable program type is **one table entry** —
`ProgTypeMap[enum] = &BpfProgType{Name, User, Kern (context type),
SecDefs, FuncProtos, Helpers, ctxAccess}` (`prog/brf_types.go:504`):

- `SecDefs` — `{SEC-prefix, SecDefGenFunc, sleepable}`
  (`prog/brf_legacy.go:12`).  The gen func is *tiny* — `GenLsmEntry`
  picks one of 7 LSM hook names; `GenBPFTrampoline` returns a single
  string (`brf_types.go:1492-1508`).  It picks the **attach
  target**, nothing more.
- `FuncProtos` / `Helpers` — the helper/kfunc set.
- `ctxAccess` (`CtxAccessMap`, `brf_types.go:1510`) — which context
  fields the program may read/write.

The program *body* is generated generically by `NewBpfProg`
(`brf_legacy.go:305`) from that table entry.  **Key finding: adding
a program type is mostly filling in a table entry, not writing a
generator.**

## The struct_ops gap (Stage A finding)

`BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS` is stubbed in **three places**:

1. `ProgTypeMap` — the entry is **commented out**
   (`brf_types.go:1302-1311`); its `SecDef` gen func is `nil` and
   `FuncProtos` is empty (`//XXX: why missing this prog type`).
2. `BPF_MAP_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS` — present in the map-type table but
   `continue`-skipped in two spots (`brf_legacy.go` ~1064, ~1161).
3. No `CtxAccessMap` entry — no context model.

BRF's authors sketched struct_ops and bailed.

## Design — targeted, not generic

Reviving struct_ops **generically** (for arbitrary kernel structs
— `tcp_congestion_ops`, `sched_ext`, …) is the L+ trap the authors
abandoned.  **We do not do that.**  Phase 3 makes BRF generate
struct_ops programs **specifically for `mptcp_sched_ops`** — one
struct, 2-4 callbacks, a known kfunc set, a small known context
(`struct mptcp_sock *`).  That reuses BRF's body generator
wholesale; the new code is table entries + one scaffold branch.

### Stage B — load plumbing + the lite floor (DONE 2026-05-22)

Implemented in `executor/bpf_progs/` (`mptcp_sched.bpf.c` +
`test_mptcp_bpf_sched.c`); build/run procedure and verified
output in `executor/bpf_progs/README.md`.  Original plan:

- Hand-write one fixed `mptcp_sched.bpf.c` — a minimal valid
  scheduler (`get_send`/`get_retrans` returning a subflow), with
  the `SEC(".struct_ops") struct mptcp_sched_ops` instance.
- Regenerate `/mnt/brf_work_dir/vmlinux.h` from the BTF-enabled
  kernel (`bpftool btf dump file <vmlinux> format c`).
- Compile it with `clang-21` (the existing `compileBpfProg` flags).
- Load + register via libbpf — already linked into `syz-executor`
  (`-lbpf`); `bpf_object__open` + `bpf_map__attach_struct_ops`.
- Select it with the `scheduler` sysctl — `syz_mptcp_set_sysctl`
  (gap 6, `MPTCP_SYSCTL_SCHEDULER`).
- This proves the kernel path end to end and **is the Phase-3-lite
  floor** — a guaranteed-demoable result even if Stage C overruns.

### Stage C — the generator core (~2-3 weeks, the bulk + the risk)

**Stage C-minimal is implemented** — see "Stage C-minimal —
implemented" under Status above for the as-built five-piece
breakdown.  The original plan, for reference:

- Uncomment / add the `BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS` entry in
  `ProgTypeMap`, **targeted at `mptcp_sched_ops`**.  *(As built: a
  real entry; `SecDefs` `{"struct_ops", nil, false}` — the callback
  names are fixed by the renderer so no `SecDefGenFunc`; kfuncs are
  modelled separately as `BpfKfunc`, so `FuncProtos` is empty.)*
- Add a `CtxAccessMap` entry — the read/write surface. *(As built:
  `CtxAccessMap[BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS]` records broad reads +
  the two writable fields.)*
- Render the `SEC(".struct_ops.link") struct mptcp_sched_ops`
  instance. *(As built: a dedicated `genStructOpsSource` renderer
  rather than a branch in `genCSource` — the struct_ops C shape is
  different enough that a separate renderer is cleaner and leaves
  `genCSource` untouched.)*
- Generate the callback bodies. *(As built: `genStructOpsBody`
  generates the `get_send` body — ctx reads/writes + arithmetic;
  `init`/`release` are empty for Stage C-minimal.)*

**Still pending (Stage C-full / D):**
- Arbitrary MPTCP kfunc-call generation (the other 7 kfuncs,
  iterator kfuncs, `bpf_for_each(mptcp_subflow, …)`).
- Generated non-empty `init`/`release` (e.g. `BPF_MAP_TYPE_SK_STORAGE`
  per-msk state, as in `mptcp_bpf_rr.c`).
- Verifier-pass iteration on generated bodies — the genuine risk;
  unknown until a VM run.  The Stage C-minimal body is deliberately
  conservative (writes confined to the two
  `bpf_mptcp_sched_btf_struct_access` fields, no kfunc-return
  dereferences beyond the null-checked `subflow`) to maximise the
  first-pass verifier-accept rate.

### Stage D — wire + fuzz (~days)

- `syz_mptcp_load_sched_bpf` pseudo-syscall (executor + syzlang +
  registration), or wire generation into the existing
  `syz_bpf_prog_*` path.
- Work-dir pruning — keep `.c`/`.o`/`.gob` only for corpus
  programs; the generator must not fill `/mnt/brf_work_dir`
  unboundedly (it is already 73 GB of stale artifacts; clear it).
- Drive traffic, measure find-rate.

## Estimate

**~3-5 weeks of focused work.**  Stage B ships in days and is the
guaranteed-demoable floor.  Stage C is the genuine flagship and
where overrun risk lives.  **Not done by the 2026-06-01
submission** — the submission presents Phase 3 as the
flagship-in-progress; the **2026-07-13 talk** is the landing
target.

## Risks / open items

- `mutBpfProg` (`brf.go:309`) is a stub — BRF only generates fresh
  programs, never mutates them.  This caps coverage-guided
  exploration of the scheduler.  Fixing it is a Stage D
  consideration, not a Stage C blocker.
- `/mnt/brf_work_dir` disk growth once the generator runs — do not
  freeze the generator (kills exploration); prune instead.
- Verifier-pass rate on generated struct_ops bodies — unknown
  until Stage C; the fixed Stage B scheduler de-risks the
  load/registration path independently.
