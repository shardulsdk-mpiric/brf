# MPTCP MP_JOIN harness design

**Read this when:** designing, implementing, debugging, or extending
the MPTCP MP_JOIN fuzz harness in this BRF tree.  When designing a
sibling harness for QUIC handshake or NET_HANDSHAKE / tlshd, read
this first as the worked example, then specialise.

**Companion documents:**
- `.claude/designs/brf_architecture.md` (Section 7 is the recipe this
  doc instantiates).
- `.claude/users/shardul/tasks/mptcp_protocol_fuzzing/CLAUDE.md` (task brief,
  scope and constraints).
- `.claude/users/shardul/tasks/mptcp_protocol_fuzzing/context_reference.md`
  (strategic context, citation discipline).

**Status:** v0 draft, 2026-05-15.  No code written yet.  This doc
fixes the design before implementation so the harness lands in
idiomatic BRF shape on first try.

## 1. Goal

Build a BRF-style pseudo-syscall harness for the MPTCP MP_JOIN
handshake (RFC 8684 Section 3.2) that satisfies the cryptographic
gates which currently block any stateless Syzkaller fuzzer from
reaching MP_JOIN-validation code paths.

**The load-bearing claim:** with this harness, a fuzzer can produce
syntactically valid MP_JOIN suboptions (correct token, correct HMAC
over correct nonces and keys) **and** controlled, semantically
meaningful mutations of those suboptions -- so HMAC-validation, DSS
mapping, and subflow-state code paths receive real coverage that
the upstream Syzkaller stack cannot deliver.

Why this specific flow first:

- Deepest existing MPTCP expertise (Shardul's HMAC-A / HMAC-B
  fixes upstream).
- Clearest single cryptographic gate (HMAC over four pieces of
  captured state); proving the harness here generalises.
- Active maintainer team (matttbe, Mat Martineau, Geliang Tang,
  Paolo Abeni) and syzbot integration -- any bug found has a
  direct upstream path.

## 2. The cryptographic gates this harness must clear

Recap from the gate map (agent research, 2026-05-15) -- these are
the gates where a random fuzzer fails:

| Gate                                  | Probability of stateless pass | What is needed                                                |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| MP_JOIN token lookup                  | 0%                           | Live `msk->token` registered by a prior MP_CAPABLE exchange    |
| MP_JOIN HMAC validation (server side) | < 2^-64 per attempt          | HMAC-SHA256(local_key||remote_key, local_nonce||remote_nonce)  |
| MP_JOIN HMAC validation (client side) | < 2^-160 per attempt         | Full 20-byte HMAC over the same inputs                         |
| MP_DSS mapping validity / csum        | ~1:2^32 if csum enabled      | Negotiated csum mode + valid CRC-32C over payload              |
| Subflow accept readiness              | ~50% (depends on msk state)  | `msk` fully established and PM accepts subflows                |

The harness's job is to **make each of these probabilities
controllable** -- 100% in normal mode (proves we reach past the
gate), and a *defined* probability in mutation mode (proves the
mutation reaches the kernel parser).

## 3. Pseudo-syscall family

Five pseudo-syscalls (subject to refinement after first build).
All declared in a new file `sys/linux/socket_mptcp_crypto.txt`,
implemented in a new header `executor/common_brf_linux_mptcp.h`.

### 3.1 Resource and state types (syzlang)

```
resource mptcp_pair[intptr]

mptcp_init_flags = MPTCP_INIT_CSUM_ON, MPTCP_INIT_CSUM_OFF,
                   MPTCP_INIT_DENY_JOIN_ID0
mptcp_nonce_mut  = MPTCP_NONCE_NORMAL, MPTCP_NONCE_ZERO,
                   MPTCP_NONCE_FLIP_HIGH, MPTCP_NONCE_FLIP_LOW,
                   MPTCP_NONCE_REPLAY
mptcp_hmac_mut   = MPTCP_HMAC_NORMAL, MPTCP_HMAC_ZERO,
                   MPTCP_HMAC_BIT_FLIP, MPTCP_HMAC_TRUNCATE,
                   MPTCP_HMAC_SWAP
mptcp_map_mut    = MPTCP_MAP_NORMAL, MPTCP_MAP_STALE_SEQ,
                   MPTCP_MAP_OFF_BY_ONE, MPTCP_MAP_INFINITE,
                   MPTCP_MAP_HOLE
mptcp_control_subopt = MPTCP_CTL_FAIL, MPTCP_CTL_FASTCLOSE,
                       MPTCP_CTL_RST

mptcp_pair_state {
    /* Out-param populated by syz_mptcp_pair_init.  Visible to
     * the fuzzer descriptor evaluator so subsequent syscalls
     * can resource-reference fields if needed.  Most consumers
     * only need the opaque mptcp_pair handle. */
    server_fd        int32
    client_fd        int32
    local_key        int64
    remote_key       int64
    token            int32
    csum_enabled     int8
}
```

### 3.2 The five syscalls (syzlang)

```
# Create server + client pair, complete MP_CAPABLE, capture
# all cryptographic state.  Returns an opaque pair handle.
syz_mptcp_pair_init(
    server_addr ptr[in, sockaddr_storage],
    client_addr ptr[in, sockaddr_storage],
    flags       flags[mptcp_init_flags, int32],
    out_state   ptr[out, mptcp_pair_state]
) mptcp_pair

# Initiate MP_JOIN from a new client-side subflow.  In NORMAL
# mode, all crypto material is correct and the join succeeds.
# In mutation modes, the executor mutates exactly the named
# field, leaving everything else valid -- so kernel parser
# failures are attributable.
syz_mptcp_join_subflow(
    pair      mptcp_pair,
    addr_id   int8,
    backup    bool8,
    nonce_mut flags[mptcp_nonce_mut, int8],
    hmac_mut  flags[mptcp_hmac_mut, int8]
)

# Send data through an established subflow, optionally with a
# mutated DSS mapping.
syz_mptcp_drive_traffic(
    pair       mptcp_pair,
    subflow_id int32,
    data       ptr[in, array[int8]],
    data_len   bytesize[data, int32],
    map_mut    flags[mptcp_map_mut, int8]
)

# Inject a control suboption (MP_FAIL, MP_FASTCLOSE, MP_RST)
# at a specific point in the connection.  Tests recovery paths.
syz_mptcp_send_control(
    pair       mptcp_pair,
    subflow_id int32,
    suboption  flags[mptcp_control_subopt, int8]
)

# Closeout.  Frees state slot, closes file descriptors.
syz_mptcp_pair_close(pair mptcp_pair)
```

## 4. The state-carrier struct (C)

`executor/common_brf_linux_mptcp.h`:

```c
#define MPTCP_PAIR_POOL_SIZE     16
#define MPTCP_MAX_SUBFLOWS_PER_PAIR 8

struct mptcp_subflow_state {
    uint32_t local_nonce;            /* generated locally for this subflow */
    uint32_t remote_nonce;           /* extracted from peer's SYN-ACK     */
    uint8_t  expected_thmac[8];      /* truncated HMAC; what server sends */
    uint8_t  expected_hmac[20];      /* full HMAC; what client sends      */
    int      tcp_subflow_fd;         /* the joined TCP subflow            */
    bool     established;            /* MP_JOIN ACK received and accepted */
};

struct mptcp_pair_state_c {
    bool     in_use;

    /* Endpoint sockets */
    int      server_listen_fd;       /* IPPROTO_MPTCP listening socket    */
    int      server_msk_fd;          /* accepted msk after MP_CAPABLE     */
    int      client_msk_fd;          /* client side msk                   */

    /* MP_CAPABLE-captured cryptographic state.
     * Per RFC 8684 Section 3.1, both keys are exchanged during
     * MP_CAPABLE.  The token is SHA-256(remote_key) truncated
     * to 32 bits.  IDSN is the bottom 64 bits of SHA-256(remote_key).
     */
    uint64_t local_key;
    uint64_t remote_key;
    uint32_t token;
    uint64_t idsn_local;
    uint64_t idsn_remote;
    bool     csum_enabled;
    bool     deny_join_id0;

    /* Per-subflow state. */
    struct mptcp_subflow_state subflows[MPTCP_MAX_SUBFLOWS_PER_PAIR];
    int      subflow_count;

    /* Diagnostics. */
    int      last_kernel_errno;
    uint32_t last_mib_rst_reason;
};

static struct mptcp_pair_state_c mptcp_pair_pool[MPTCP_PAIR_POOL_SIZE];
```

The struct lives in static executor memory (same pattern as BRF's
`bpf_object_list`).  The `mptcp_pair` syzlang resource is the index
into this pool; the out-param `mptcp_pair_state` (syzlang) is a
projection of the C struct's user-visible fields.

## 5. The derivation pipeline

For each pseudo-syscall, what the **executor** must compute and what
the **kernel** sees:

### 5.1 syz_mptcp_pair_init

Steps in C:

```
 1. Allocate a free slot in mptcp_pair_pool; mark in_use.
 2. socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_MPTCP) for server; bind;
    listen.  Use ephemeral port if server_addr->port == 0.
 3. socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_MPTCP) for client.  Set
    setsockopt(SOL_MPTCP, MPTCP_INFO_xxx) as needed for csum mode.
 4. connect() client to server.  Wait for ESTABLISHED.
 5. Capture local_key and remote_key via the new MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS
    getsockopt.

    **Resettled, 2026-05-15 (after the initial wire-peek decision):**
    we added a small CONFIG_KCOV-gated MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS getsockopt
    to the kernel (patch 0003 of the mptcp_kcov series) that
    returns `struct mptcp_debug_keys` { local_key, remote_key }
    from the msk.  The pair_init impl calls
    `getsockopt(client_msk_fd, SOL_MPTCP, MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS, &keys,
    &len)` right after `accept()` to grab both keys; the token is
    read via the existing `MPTCP_INFO` getsockopt's mptcpi_token
    field (set by mptcp_crypto_key_sha at MP_CAPABLE time, so the
    value already matches what the kernel will compare against).

    Rationale for moving from wire-peek to a debug sockopt:

    - The harness controls both endpoints; wire-peek is the
      pattern for an external observer that does not own the
      sockets.  We do own them.
    - Removes ~300 lines of AF_PACKET / TCP-option parsing from
      the harness in exchange for ~30 lines of kernel code.
    - Removes the netns + veth setup requirement that previously
      justified the cost of wire-peek; pair_init can run entirely
      on 127.0.0.1 in the calling task's netns.
    - CONFIG_KCOV gating keeps the new sockopt firmly in the
      test/debug domain (production builds without CONFIG_KCOV do
      not expose the keys).
    - Wire-level injection is still required for the *mutation*
      paths in syz_mptcp_join_subflow / syz_mptcp_drive_traffic;
      key capture in pair_init is a separate concern.

    Original wire-peek plan kept as historical context:
    `MPTCP_INFO` and `MPTCP_FULL_INFO` expose only the 32-bit
    token, not the keys.  Two-netns + veth + AF_PACKET observer
    (recommended) and loopback + AF_PACKET on `lo` (fallback)
    were the two pre-sockopt approaches.
 6. Compute token = upper 32 bits of SHA-256(remote_key).
 7. Compute idsn_local = lower 64 bits of SHA-256(local_key);
    idsn_remote = lower 64 bits of SHA-256(remote_key).
 8. Populate out-param mptcp_pair_state.
 9. Return the pool slot index (cast as mptcp_pair resource).
```

Notes:

- Step 5 may have a chicken-and-egg problem: `MPTCP_INFO`'s key
  field may be gated by `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.  Verify against the
  current kernel in the dev_env VM; if gated, fall back to (b).
- Step 6's truncation direction is "upper 32 bits" per RFC 8684
  Section 3.2.  Verify against `net/mptcp/crypto.c
  mptcp_crypto_key_sha()` (Linux uses upper bits).

### 5.2 syz_mptcp_join_subflow

**v01 NORMAL-mode path (settled 2026-05-16; implemented).**  No wire
injection.  The harness flips `net.mptcp.pm_type=1` (userspace PM)
once per executor, opens a netlink genl socket subscribed to the
`mptcp_pm_events` multicast group (making
`mptcp_userspace_pm_active(msk)` return true netns-wide, which
satisfies the server-side acceptance gate
`mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow` in `net/mptcp/subflow.c`), and then
for each call issues:

```
MPTCP_PM_CMD_SUBFLOW_CREATE (mptcp_pm genl family) {
    MPTCP_PM_ATTR_TOKEN       = pair->token,                  /* u32 */
    MPTCP_PM_ATTR_ADDR        = { FAMILY=AF_INET,
                                  ID=addr_id (1..255),
                                  ADDR4=127.0.0.2,
                                  PORT=0 (kernel picks) },
    MPTCP_PM_ATTR_ADDR_REMOTE = { FAMILY=AF_INET,
                                  ADDR4=127.0.0.1,
                                  PORT=pair->server_listen_port }
}
```

The handler is `mptcp_pm_nl_subflow_create_doit` in
`net/mptcp/pm_userspace.c`.  It calls `__mptcp_subflow_connect`
synchronously and returns its result as the genl ack -- success
means the SYN was emitted, not that the handshake completed.  The
harness then polls `MPTCP_INFO.mptcpi_subflows` on the server-side
msk (alias of `pm.extra_subflows`) with a ~1 s ceiling.

Why userspace PM rather than the in-kernel PM:

- Kernel PM endpoint configuration only auto-fires during
  MP_CAPABLE -> ESTABLISHED; by the time `syz_mptcp_join_subflow` is
  called, that transition has already happened, so the kernel-PM
  path would not generate the subflow.  Pre-pair_init configuration
  would also conflate `pair_init` with `join_subflow` semantically.
- Userspace PM `SUBFLOW_CREATE` gives per-call explicit "kick off
  this MP_JOIN now" control, which is the correct shape for a
  pseudo-syscall.

Why a multicast listener satisfies the server-side gate:
`mptcp_userspace_pm_active` is literally
`genl_has_listeners(&mptcp_genl_family, sock_net(msk),
MPTCP_PM_EV_GRP_OFFSET)` -- subscribing once is enough; the harness
never has to read the events.

**Critical:** `pair_init` must call the setup helper BEFORE creating
any MPTCP socket.  `msk->pm.pm_type` is captured at msk-construction
time in `mptcp_pm_data_reset`; flipping the netns sysctl after the
fact does not retroactively switch existing msks to userspace mode,
and `mptcp_userspace_pm_get_sock` would then reject SUBFLOW_CREATE
with "userspace PM not selected".

**Critical (gotcha learned 2026-05-16):** after bare
`connect()`/`accept()` the server-side msk is `fully_established`
but the **client-side** msk is not.  `check_fully_established`
(`net/mptcp/options.c`) only flips the client's flag on receipt of
a DSS+use_ack-bearing packet from the server.
`__mptcp_subflow_connect` then rejects with `-ENOTCONN`
(subflow.c:1633, "userspace PM sent the request too early").
`pair_init` therefore drives a 1-byte send+recv in BOTH directions
after `accept()` so both ends transition to fully_established
before the slot index is handed back.

**Capture stance for v01 (settled 2026-05-16):** skip remote_nonce
/ thmac capture.  In NORMAL mode the kernel drives all crypto, so
capture isn't load-bearing for "is the gate reachable" verification;
the SNMP success counter (`MPJoinAckRx`) and `mptcpi_subflows`
delta are sufficient.  Capture becomes load-bearing when mutation
modes land (a per-subflow debug sockopt mirroring
`MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS`, or an AF_PACKET observer on `lo`, are the two
candidates; see Section 5.1 rationale for why we prefer the
sockopt route).

----

**Future mutation-mode path (v02; original Section 5.2 plan).**
Wire injection becomes load-bearing once we start mutating the
MP_JOIN bytes:

```
 1. Look up pair from the resource handle.
 2. Allocate a free subflow slot in pair->subflows[].
 3. Generate local_nonce = 32 bits from /dev/urandom.
 4. Craft the MP_JOIN SYN option bytes:
      type=30, len=12, subtype=1<<4|backup<<0, addr_id, token,
      local_nonce
    Apply nonce_mut to local_nonce in this buffer if mut != NORMAL.
 5. Inject the TCP SYN with this option onto loopback.  Two paths:
    (a) Use AF_PACKET + raw ethernet frame craft.
    (b) Use a TUN device that the harness owns.
    See Section 6 for the choice.
 6. Wait for SYN-ACK on the same path.  Extract remote_nonce and
    server's truncated HMAC (thmac, 8 bytes).
 7. Verify thmac matches our expectation:
      expected_thmac = first 8 bytes of HMAC-SHA256(
        key  = remote_key || local_key,
        msg  = remote_nonce || local_nonce
      )
    Note key/nonce ordering: peer-first for the responder's HMAC.
 8. Compute our HMAC for the ACK:
      hmac = HMAC-SHA256(
        key  = local_key || remote_key,
        msg  = local_nonce || remote_nonce
      )
    Apply hmac_mut to this 20-byte buffer if mut != NORMAL.
 9. Craft and inject the MP_JOIN ACK with hmac.
10. If the kernel accepts (no RST received within timeout),
    populate pair->subflows[i].established = true.
11. Return 0 on success, negative on kernel-side failure (the
    fuzzer then has a coverage signal indicating which gate
    failed).
```

The HMAC ordering, key ordering, and length-truncation details
come from RFC 8684 Section 3.2 and `net/mptcp/crypto.c
mptcp_crypto_hmac_sha()` -- verify against kernel code, not
RFC alone, since Linux conventions on byte order can differ.

### 5.3 syz_mptcp_drive_traffic

Steps in C:

```
 1. Look up pair + subflow.
 2. write(pair->subflows[subflow_id].tcp_subflow_fd, data, len);
    OR craft a TCP segment with payload + DSS option.
 3. If map_mut == NORMAL, kernel emits a correct DSS option.
 4. If map_mut != NORMAL, intercept the outgoing packet, rewrite
    the DSS bytes per the mutation, and re-emit.  Mutations:
      STALE_SEQ -- data_seq from N RTTs ago
      OFF_BY_ONE -- data_seq off by 1
      INFINITE   -- data_len = 0 (RFC: infinite mapping marker)
      HOLE       -- data_seq leaves a gap
 5. Return.  Coverage of get_mapping_status / validate_mapping
    in net/mptcp/subflow.c shows whether the kernel reached
    deep mapping validation.
```

### 5.4 syz_mptcp_send_control and syz_mptcp_pair_close

Straightforward.  `send_control` crafts a single MPTCP option
suboption with the requested type and sends it.  `pair_close`
closes all fds and clears the pool slot.

## 6. Injection mechanism choice

Three options, with tradeoffs:

| Option                       | Pros                                       | Cons                                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| (a) Real sockets on `lo`     | Kernel does TCP for us; minimal setup     | Cannot mutate options -- kernel emits its own |
| (b) AF_PACKET raw inject     | Full byte control; can mutate freely      | Must implement TCP state machine in executor |
| (c) Hybrid: real client side, AF_PACKET peer | Real kernel side for "our" endpoint; raw inject for "peer" packets | Most complex; needs careful path isolation    |

**Recommendation: split by phase.**

- **pair_init (no mutation):**  Use (a).  Both endpoints real
  kernel sockets in two netns connected by veth.  AF_PACKET
  observer on the veth to extract keys from the wire.  No
  injection needed; the kernel does all the work.  Lowest setup
  cost.
- **join_subflow + drive_traffic (mutation):**  Use (c) hybrid.
  Server endpoint stays a real socket (kernel runs the MPTCP
  parser we want to fuzz).  Client side now switches to
  AF_PACKET-crafted injection (or `iptables -j NFQUEUE` + libnetfilter_queue
  to rewrite egress packets from a real client socket).  The
  mutation knobs in the syscall descriptors decide what to
  rewrite.

Rationale: pair_init needs no injection, only observation -- so
the cheap setup is the right choice there.  join_subflow needs
to MUTATE specific byte ranges (HMAC, nonce, addr_id) -- so we
need either full AF_PACKET injection or NFQUEUE-based rewrite.

If even the join_subflow mutation path proves too complex for
v1, fall back to capture-only mode and gain some bugs from
unmutated traffic + state-machine racing (concurrent joins,
mistimed closes).  Loses targeted mutation surface but keeps the
state-carrier and PM-netlink mutation paths.

## 6.bis Kernel base for this harness

The kernel base is a tracking branch, not a frozen tag.  See
`.claude/designs/kernel_base_management.md` for the full workflow
(why tracking-not-pinning, update procedure, patch application,
reproducibility-footer convention for bug reports).

Specifically for MPTCP work:

- Local branch: `mptcp_brf_fuzz_base` in the kernel tree at
  `/mnt/work_4gb/Dev/mpiric_kernel_dev_env/open/src/kernel/linux/`.
- Upstream source: `mptcp/export` (riches surface; net-next based).
  Bug findings get routed at report time (Fixes -> mptcp/export-net;
  feature -> mptcp/export).
- Current snapshot (2026-05-15): `export/20260515T083717`.
- Update cadence: weekly between campaigns; freeze during a
  campaign; bump before any publishable run.

## 7. Kernel-side kcov instrumentation

Per `brf_architecture.md` Section 7 Step 6, reuse patch 0001 from
the kcov-for-BRF v06 set verbatim, then author an analogue of
patch 0002 for MPTCP.

### 7.1 Where to add the handle

Two reasonable choices for the per-flow struct:

- `struct mptcp_sock` (net/mptcp/protocol.h): per-msk handle.
  Coverage instrumentation wraps msk-level entry points
  (mptcp_sendmsg, mptcp_recvmsg, the PM doits).
- `struct mptcp_subflow_context` (same file): per-subflow handle.
  Wraps subflow-level entry points (subflow_data_ready,
  get_mapping_status, the MPTCP option parser hooks).

**Recommendation: both, separately wired.**  The msk handle
captures msk-level state machine.  The subflow handle captures
the gates that actually reject bad MP_JOIN bytes.  For our
purposes the subflow handle is the more important one because
the validity gates fire there.

### 7.2 Entry points to wrap

For v1, instrument at the option-parser dispatcher and the
HMAC-validation sites:

```
net/mptcp/options.c:359   mptcp_get_options          (option dispatch)
net/mptcp/options.c:35     mptcp_parse_option         (per-subtype)
net/mptcp/subflow.c:85     subflow_token_join_request (token lookup)
net/mptcp/subflow.c:753    subflow_hmac_valid          (server-side HMAC)
net/mptcp/subflow.c:414    subflow_thmac_valid         (client-side HMAC)
net/mptcp/subflow.c:1109   get_mapping_status          (DSS mapping)
net/mptcp/subflow.c:915    mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow
net/mptcp/pm.c:*           mptcp_pm_*                  (PM events)
```

Wrap each in `kcov_remote_start_prealloc(handle, area, size)` /
`kcov_remote_stop_prealloc()` calls keyed on the appropriate
struct's handle field.

### 7.3 How userspace gets the handle into the kernel

For BPF, BRF passes the handle via `bpf_attr.kcov_remote_handle`
(patch 0002).  For MPTCP, the equivalent is a setsockopt or a
netlink call.  Options:

- New `setsockopt(SOL_MPTCP, MPTCP_KCOV_HANDLE, &handle)`.
  Cleanest, but requires a new sockopt code.
- Repurpose an existing debug sockopt under `#ifdef CONFIG_KCOV`.
  Cheaper to land.
- Userspace netlink op via `mptcp_pm_genl_family`.  Heavy.

**Recommendation: new setsockopt under CONFIG_KCOV.**  Mirrors
how BPF does it and isolates the change cleanly.

### 7.4 Patch series structure

Following the BRF v06 pattern:

```
0001-kcov: applied verbatim from BRF v06 (already exists).
0002-mptcp: adds kcov_remote_handle / area / size to
            mptcp_sock + mptcp_subflow_context; wraps the
            entry points listed in 7.2; defines the new
            setsockopt.
0003-mptcp: (optional) expose handle via MPTCP_INFO getsockopt.
```

Drafts of 0002 / 0003 will live as patches in this BRF tree
under (TBD path, possibly `kernel_patches/mptcp_kcov/`) when
they are written, in a sibling tree to where the existing
v06 lives.

## 8. v1 mutation set (what to actually fuzz first)

Keep the mutation surface tight at v1.  All controlled by the
mutation-flag enums in Section 3.

| Field             | Mutations                                         | Tests which gate                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| local_nonce       | ZERO, FLIP_HIGH, FLIP_LOW, REPLAY                | server-side HMAC validation               |
| client HMAC       | ZERO, BIT_FLIP, TRUNCATE, SWAP                   | server's `subflow_hmac_valid`             |
| addr_id           | 0 (reserved), out-of-range, not-advertised        | `subflow_chk_local_id`, PM validation     |
| DSS mapping       | STALE_SEQ, OFF_BY_ONE, INFINITE, HOLE             | `get_mapping_status`, `validate_mapping`  |
| Control suboption | MP_FAIL mid-stream, MP_FASTCLOSE mid-stream, MP_RST at unexpected times | recovery / fallback paths    |

Out of scope for v1 (worth at v2 if time permits):

- Concurrent MP_JOIN races (issue #621 territory; requires
  multi-thread injection).
- Subflow ADD_ADDR / RM_ADDR / MP_PRIO mutations.
- IPv6 (start IPv4-only; widen once IPv4 path is solid).
- Cross-namespace MPTCP (the "EMPTCP" paths Shardul's
  HMAC-A/B work touched).

## 9. First-runs success criteria

**Harness-validity criteria** (must pass before claiming the
harness works):

1. **Normal-mode coverage:**  Running 100 inputs with all
   mutation flags set to NORMAL, kcov shows entry into
   `subflow_hmac_valid` (server side) AND `subflow_thmac_valid`
   (client side) AND `mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow` returning
   true.  The /proc/net/netstat counter `MPJoinAckRx`
   (`MPTCP_MIB_JOINACKRX`, mib.c:29) increments.

   **Naming caveat (recorded 2026-05-16):** the kernel symbol
   `MPTCP_MIB_JOINACKMAC` is *not* a success counter despite its
   suggestive name -- it maps to `"MPJoinAckHMacFailure"` in
   /proc/net/netstat (mib.c:30) and counts HMAC validation
   failures on the server side.  The success counter we want is
   `MPJoinAckRx`.  Earlier revisions of this design doc referred
   to `MPTCP_MIB_JOINACKMAC` as the success criterion; that was
   a misnomer and has been corrected.
2. **Mutation reachability:**  Running 100 inputs with each
   mutation enum value at least once, the relevant counter
   increments AND the corresponding RST reason fires when
   expected.  Specifically:
   - HMAC mutations -> `MPTCP_RST_EPROHIBIT` increments AND
     `MPJoinAckHMacFailure` (the real `MPTCP_MIB_JOINACKMAC`)
     increments on the server.
   - Token unknown (e.g., closing a pair mid-test) ->
     `MPJoinNoTokenFound` (`MPTCP_MIB_JOINNOTOKEN`) increments.
3. **Coverage growth:**  Over a 5-minute run, new basic blocks
   in `net/mptcp/subflow.c` and `net/mptcp/options.c` are
   discovered.  Plateau within 5 minutes is OK; zero growth
   indicates a stuck harness.

**Bug-finding criteria** (the talk's actual deliverable):

1. KASAN report on any MPTCP code path.
2. WARN_ON / lockdep splat in `net/mptcp/`.
3. Hung-task or softlockup attributable to MPTCP.
4. Unexpected RST reason (logic bug rather than parser
   rejection).
5. Memory leak (kmemleak hit) in mptcp/subflow lifetime.

Any one of these, with a deterministic reproducer, is a
publishable finding.  Per the project memory
`feedback_netdev_framing_provisional.md`, bug findings are
load-bearing for the talk -- the harness's value as
infrastructure is incomplete without them.

## 10. What can go wrong (anti-scope and risks)

- **Client-side fully_established is not set by connect() alone.**
  *Observed 2026-05-16 during first smoke run.*  After bare
  `connect()`/`accept()` the server msk is `fully_established`
  (set by the server's third-ACK processing in
  `mptcp_sock_create_accept`, protocol.c:3619) but the client msk
  is not -- the client's flag only flips inside
  `check_fully_established` (options.c:942) on receipt of a
  packet from the server carrying DSS with `use_ack`.
  `__mptcp_subflow_connect` returns `-ENOTCONN` (subflow.c:1633)
  if the userspace PM issues `SUBFLOW_CREATE` on a not-yet-
  fully_established client msk.  Mitigation in `pair_init`: drive
  a 1-byte send+recv in both directions after `accept()` before
  handing the slot index back.
- **`MPTCP_PM_ADDR_ATTR_PORT` is host-byte order, not network.**
  *Observed 2026-05-16 during second smoke run.*  Kernel uapi
  quirk: `mptcp_pm_parse_pm_addr_attr` (pm_netlink.c:86) reads
  the port via `htons(nla_get_u16(...))`, so the attribute value
  must be in HOST byte order.  This is asymmetric with
  `MPTCP_PM_ADDR_ATTR_ADDR4`, which is the natural
  network-byte-order address that `nla_get_in_addr` returns
  raw.  Passing `sin_port` (NBO) directly here causes the
  kernel to byteswap a second time and aim the MP_JOIN SYN at
  a random port -- the failure mode is completely silent (no
  RST visible to userspace, no MPTCP debug, no SS entry, no
  MIB delta, no dmesg) because the SYN goes out on the wire
  to a non-listening port and gets RST'd on the way in,
  before any MPTCP code path sees it.  Pass `ntohs(sin_port)`.
  Reference for the right pattern: iproute2's `ip mptcp` does
  it correctly.
- **MPTCP info getsockopt may not expose keys.**  Resolved by the
  `MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS` patch (0003 of the mptcp_kcov series).
  Original concern preserved here for the historical record.
- **AF_PACKET raw inject on loopback may race with kernel's own
  TCP.**  Use a dummy netdev or netns to isolate, or run in a
  fresh netns per pair.
- **HMAC byte ordering subtleties.**  RFC 8684 vs Linux's
  implementation: cross-reference `net/mptcp/crypto.c` directly
  rather than trusting the RFC paraphrase here.
- **MPTCP version negotiation.**  RFC 8684 added a version field;
  earlier kernels handled it slightly differently.  Pin to the
  dev_env kernel version and document.
- **Synchronous-handshake timeouts.**  If the harness's injected
  packets are too slow (or too fast), the kernel may reset or
  ignore.  Use the same timing the kernel itself uses (TCP
  retransmit defaults) as the starting point.

## 11. Open questions to settle before implementation

1. **Pair-init key capture path:** ~~(a) MPTCP_INFO getsockopt vs
   (b) raw-socket peek.~~  **Settled 2026-05-15.**  Wire-peek (no
   uapi exposes the keys).  Sub-choice between (a) two-netns +
   veth + AF_PACKET observer vs (b) loopback + AF_PACKET on lo;
   recommendation (a) for cleanliness.  See Section 5.1.
2. **netns vs loopback isolation.**  ~~Per-pair fresh netns is
   cleanest but adds setup latency.~~  ~~Persistent two-netns +
   veth pair.~~  **Resettled 2026-05-15.**  v01 uses *no* netns
   isolation: both endpoints live on 127.0.0.1 in the calling
   task's netns.  The wire-peek requirement that previously
   justified veth+netns went away when key capture moved to the
   MPTCP_DEBUG_KEYS sockopt (Q1 above).  netns isolation can be
   reintroduced in v02 if cross-pair contention shows up in
   parallel fuzz runs; the syzlang surface does not change.
3. **Kcov-handle plumbing path.**  ~~setsockopt vs other.~~
   **Settled 2026-05-15.** New `setsockopt(SOL_MPTCP,
   MPTCP_KCOV_HANDLE, &handle)` under `CONFIG_KCOV`.  See 7.3.
4. **Coverage instrumentation granularity:** ~~msk-level vs
   subflow-level vs both.~~  **Settled 2026-05-15.**  Both, but
   start subflow-only if patch complexity is an issue.  The
   gates we care about (HMAC, token, DSS) fire at subflow level.

## 12. Implementation order (when work starts)

1. Write the syzlang descriptions (Section 3) and run syz-sysgen
   to verify they parse without errors.  Sanity check.
2. Skeleton `executor/common_brf_linux_mptcp.h` with empty
   implementations and the static pool defined.  Compiles.
3. Implement `syz_mptcp_pair_init` end-to-end with no mutations
   -- prove key capture works.
4. Author the kernel-side kcov patches (0002-mptcp, 0003-mptcp)
   off the BRF v06 0001 patch as base.
5. Boot the dev_env VM with the patched kernel.  Verify kcov
   handle plumbing end-to-end on a sample MPTCP connection.
6. Implement `syz_mptcp_join_subflow` in NORMAL mode only.
   Verify HMAC validation gate is reached and passes.
7. Add mutation modes one enum value at a time.  Verify each
   mutation produces the expected kernel signal (RST reason,
   counter increment, coverage delta).
8. Implement `syz_mptcp_drive_traffic` and `syz_mptcp_send_control`.
9. Wire the new pseudo-syscalls into BRF's generator (Section 7.4
   of `brf_architecture.md`).  Start with the simpler "extend
   GenPrologue" option (a); refactor to "sibling fuzzer" (b) if
   it turns out to be needed.
10. First fuzz run.  Measure success criteria from Section 9.

Time-box each step.  If step N takes longer than 2x the planned
time, surface the blocker rather than grinding.
